    <p class="texas-tech">Baker Mayfield began his college career at Texas Tech in 2013, where he quickly made history as the first walk-on true freshman quarterback to start a season opener. Despite not having a scholarship, he impressed early with his accuracy and leadership, throwing for over 2,300 yards and 12 touchdowns in just eight games. However, injuries and tension with coaches over communication and playing time led to frustration. His competitive nature sometimes came off as arrogance, creating conflict within the team. Feeling disrespected, Mayfield decided to transfer, showing both his stubbornness and determination to prove himself elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="oklahoma">At Oklahoma, Mayfield’s talent fully emerged, turning him into one of the best quarterbacks in college football. He led the Sooners to multiple playoff appearances, throwing for over 12,000 yards and 119 touchdowns. His fiery personality was always on display—he taunted opponents, planted flags, and made controversial gestures that drew national criticism. Yet, behind the attitude was unmatched confidence and a drive to win. Mayfield’s leadership and skill earned him the 2017 Heisman Trophy, proving that his passion and edge, while sometimes problematic, fueled his success and made him a college football legend.</p>

  <p class="Browns-Stats">Baker Mayfield’s time with the Cleveland Browns started with high expectations after being drafted first overall in 2018. He brought energy and hope to a franchise long known for losing, even leading them to their first playoff win in decades. However, his relationship with the Browns organization began to sour after inconsistent performances and frequent coaching changes. Tension grew between Mayfield and management, especially after the team pursued Deshaun Watson. Injuries and public criticism from both sides made the situation worse, leading to an ugly breakup. By 2022, Mayfield was traded, ending his once-promising chapter in Cleveland on bad terms.
  </p>
    <p class="Panthers-Stats">Mayfield joined the Carolina Panthers in 2022 hoping for a fresh start and a chance to prove himself. However, things didn’t go as planned—he struggled to adapt to a new offense and dealt with poor team chemistry. His accuracy and decision-making dipped, leading to multiple benchings throughout the season. The Panthers’ unstable coaching situation didn’t help, and frustration grew on both sides. By midseason, it became clear that Mayfield wasn’t the long-term answer, and he was eventually released. His short stint in Carolina was disappointing, leaving questions about his future in the NFL.</p>
      <p class="Rams-Stats">After being released by the Panthers, Mayfield signed with the Los Angeles Rams late in the 2022 season. Just two days after joining the team, he delivered one of the most incredible moments of his career—a 98-yard game-winning drive against the Las Vegas Raiders on Thursday Night Football. His poise, accuracy, and leadership in that comeback reminded fans of his potential. The Rams praised his quick learning and competitive spirit despite limited preparation time. Though his stint was brief, Mayfield regained respect across the league for his resilience. It showed that under pressure, he could still perform like a top quarterback.</p>
        <p class="Buccaneers-Stats"> In 2023, Mayfield signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where his career finally stabilized. Taking over after Tom Brady’s retirement, he faced massive pressure but exceeded expectations. His chemistry with receivers like Mike Evans helped revitalize the offense, and his decision-making improved greatly. Mayfield displayed maturity, controlling his emotions while still playing with the same fire that defined him in college. His leadership and consistent play earned him respect in the locker room and around the league. For the first time since his rookie year, Baker Mayfield looked comfortable, confident, and ready to lead a playoff-caliber team.</p>
