        Baker Mayfield has long shown that with the right setup, he has the potential to be one of football’s greats. During his college career at Oklahoma, he threw for over 14,000 yards and 131 touchdowns, winning the Heisman Trophy and proving his ability to lead under pressure. His fierce competitiveness and clutch performances made him one of the most successful quarterbacks in college football history. When he was drafted first overall by the Cleveland Browns in 2018, many believed he could finally turn around a struggling franchise. Even though he faced organizational instability, constant coaching changes, and internal conflict, Mayfield still led Cleveland to its first playoff win in decades, showing glimpses of greatness despite the chaos around him.

After short, rocky stints with the Panthers and Rams, he reminded the league of his talent with an unforgettable 98-yard game-winning drive against the Raiders. That moment reignited belief in his ability to perform on the biggest stage, even with limited preparation. Since joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Mayfield’s career has reached a new level of consistency and maturity. He’s thrived in a stable system, improved his accuracy, and become a respected leader in the locker room. Critics who once called his attitude a weakness now see it as the competitive edge that fuels his success.

If Mayfield continues this trajectory—staying healthy, maintaining leadership, and leading deep playoff runs—he could redefine how people view his legacy. Surrounded by the right coaches, teammates, and organizational support, he’s proving that environment matters as much as talent. With the right setup for success, Baker Mayfield’s story could evolve from one of controversy and doubt to one of redemption and greatness—cementing his name among the modern-day greats of the game.
