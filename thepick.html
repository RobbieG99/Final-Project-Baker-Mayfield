        In 2018, Baker Mayfield was selected as the first overall pick by the Cleveland Browns, marking what many believed to be a turning point for the struggling franchise. 
        After years of disappointing seasons and constant quarterback changes, the Browns finally landed a player who had achieved greatness in college and brought a winning mindset. 
        Mayfield’s confidence, leadership, and competitive spirit gave fans renewed hope that Cleveland could rebuild its reputation. His selection symbolized a new era, one fueled by talent and determination rather than frustration and failure. 
        With a strong supporting draft class and new energy surrounding the team, expectations soared for a fresh beginning. Many saw Mayfield as the perfect fit to revive a franchise long associated with mediocrity. 
        His college success at Oklahoma and fiery attitude suggested he could handle the pressure of turning the Browns around. The excitement among fans and analysts was unmatched, as Cleveland looked ready to leave its losing history behind. 
        Even with lingering doubts about his size and maturity, most agreed that Mayfield represented the franchise’s best chance at a comeback. For the first time in years, the Browns had hope—and a quarterback to believe in.

          Baker Mayfield’s journey to becoming the first overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft was filled with controversy. 
          In 2017, he was arrested in Arkansas for public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest, which raised serious questions about his maturity and decision-making

          Despite his strong college performance, many critics worried that his behavior off the field could overshadow his talent. 
          Mayfield’s fiery competitiveness also sparked debate when he taunted opponents and celebrated with over-the-top gestures, actions some viewed as disrespectful. 
          When asked about these character concerns, he confidently responded that he wasn’t “trying to please everybody,” showing both pride and defiance toward his critics

          This attitude divided fans—some admired his confidence, while others saw arrogance. 
          Comparisons to Johnny Manziel, another controversial and undersized quarterback, deepened skepticism about his maturity. 
          Analysts also questioned whether Mayfield’s height and college play style would translate to success in the NFL. 
          Later reports that he kept a list of media members who had criticized him only reinforced his reputation for holding grudges. 
          Even after being drafted, his mix of talent, attitude, and controversy made him one of the most polarizing figures in football
